## Introduction
Data in the real world and that provided for academia are completely different.
Data provided for academia is for teaching purposes and is generally ideal with minimal corrections required to provide examples.
Real world data is messy and untidy with no real structure, and would otherwise overwhelm students.

This projects intent is to simulate in between where real world data has been structured to suit the providers needs, gathering to put to practice that which has been learnt academically.

Generally:
- [ ] Gathering data, webscraping raw data or via an API
- [ ] Assessing format and quality of data, the conversions required to make analysing possible and straightforward
- [ ] Cleaning utilising programmatic methods to scale for future expansion and editing of unpredictable changes

## Import Libaries
Generally, run : <br>
- [ ] pip install pandas <br>, which by default will download numpy
- [ ] pip install requests <br>
- [ ] pip install tweepy <br>

`Optional - provides Table Of Contents`
- [ ] pip install jupyter_contrib_nbextensions

## Function Definition:
`add_files(*filename)`
- returns file added, as a string
- global variable: filelist
* tracks files added so far in a list, saves time scrolling
* can pass multiple parameters, for loop will iterate to catch all

`get_values(df, col)`
- returns value_counts, as a series
- parameter: <dataframe>, <dataframe.column>
* automates .value_counts() for all columns/variables in a dataframe
* based on .values, will print out if duplicates are evident and the max number reoccuring number.
* does not provide feedback on indexes

`go_assess(df)`
- calls get_values for each column in a dataframe
- parameter: <dataframe>

## Steps:
1. Twitter archive data:
- Read in provided CSV, from subfolder using pandas.
- Check file imported correctly.
- Create two copies, one backup of original and one to be cleaned.

2. Twitter Image Prediction data:
- Access URL and download image predictions using Requests.
- Binary read/write not required as image predictions would not be enclosed in a TSV file.
- Read in TSV file into pandas dataframe.
- Check file imported correctly.
- Create two copies, one backup of original and one to be cleaned.

3. Assess data:
3.1 Iteration 1
- Visually assess using .sample(qty), files are already in folder ready to be assessed in external programs.
- Programmatically assess using .info, .describe, value_counts, isnull
Quality checklist (Completeness, Validity, Accuracy, Consistency):
- [ ] Format
- [ ] Duplicates
- [ ] Nulls
- [ ] Data Types
- [ ] Matching 
Structure checklist
- [ ] Single values per variable/column
- [ ] Variables match purpose of table i.e. correct schema


3.1.1 Observations from .head() - Twitter data archive:
`[V]=visual, [P]=programmatically, [O]=Optional`
* 17 Variables in total

- Col0 tweet_id:
[P]
* Integer datatype suits content
* No nulls: .info()
* No duplicates: df_twitter.tweet_id[df_twitter.tweet_id.duplicated()]
* No outliers in values: .info()

- Col1-2 in_reply_to_status_id, in_reply_to_user_id:
[P][V] 
* Float datatype precision not required
[P]
* Significant quantity of values are missing
* Possible outlier values, e+ seen in describe min values different in relation to the other values

- Col3 timestamp:
* [P][V] Contains date and timestamp that can be split into additional columns = Date, Time
* [V][O] Contains +0000 at the end, research indicates its purpose is to display the timezone.
		 Extract into timezone column.
* Remove data past 01 Aug 2017 i.e. 2017/08/01 as requested

- Col4 source:
* [P][V] Contains HTML tags, extract URL

- Col5 text:
* [V] Contains description of the tweet, details of the dog, description of the picture

- Col6-7 retweet_status_id, ..._user_id:
* [V] See Col1-2 comments above, similar findings

- Col8 retweet_status_timestamp:
* [P][V] Significant values missing

- Col9 expanded_urls:
* [P][V] Contains duplicates within row value

- Col10, 11 rating:
[P][V]
* Numerator exceeds 10
* Denominator is always 10, redundant information
`no change required as requested`

- Col12 name:
* [P][V] .value_counts shows significant number of `names not provided` and `duplicates`

3.1.2 Observations from .head() - Twitter image recognition:
`[V]=visual, [P]=programmatically, [O]=Optional`
[P][V]
* Globally, there are `no null` entries for all columns
* 12 Variables in total

- Col0 tweet_id:
[P] 
* Integer datatype matches that found in twitter dataframe, will merge based on this primary/foreign key
[P][V] 
* Data is valid
* Correct integer lengths
* unique and conforms to a schema
* No structure issues found.

- Col1 jpg_url
[P][V]
* Values appear consistent
* Variable is descriptive, however inaccurate as there are extensions not of .jpg
* Datatype suits content
[P]
* Duplicates are present and seem correct as these could be retweets, possibly?

- Col2 img_num
[P][V] 
* Appears completely
* Unsure of purpose, information lacking
* Max value is 4, min is 1
* Duplicates values are expected, the data here appears to be categorical, unsure of how it is quantified/measured from initial observation

- Col3 p1, Col6 p2, Col9 p3
[P][V]
* Mix of lower and proper case
* Data validity/machine learning prediction accuracy issues, i.e. canoe, suit, candle are prevalent. Purpose of the file is to provide predictive images of dogs
* Contains no white space
* Consistency - String has a mix of lower and proper case

- Col4 p1_conf, Col7 p2_conf, Col10 p3_conf
[P][V]
* Confidence of the p1 observation made by the program
* Datatype suits
* Value is not greater than 1, i.e. 100%

- Col5 p1_dog, Col8 p2_dog, Col11 p3_dog
[P][V]
* Data validity issue with false numbers not matching those found in col3 mask, cross reference required to see what col5 false value equate to those found matched in col3
 

3.2 Summary:
3.2.1 Quality Issues:


3.2.2 Structure Issues:

4. Cleaning
4.1 Twitter data

4.2 image predictions



==================================================
Upgrades:
- add file tracker
- assess function
 - requirements: specify column (series) as functions do not apply to whole dataframe
 - argument = dataframe.seriesname
- create memory release, for dataframes that have been copied

Results
- Prepare:
1.1 wrangle_act.ipynb
1.2 wrangle__report.pdf/html for documentation of steps
